#### Exploring recursive grids with Processing Python mode

Recursion in computation allows for creating intricate and often fractal-like forms with relatively little code.  *Processing Python mode* is a less well known programming tool from the Processing Foundation supported ecosystem (with better known siblings *P5js* and *Processing Java mode*, formerly named "Standard mode").

In two live-coding based 3-hour sessions the participants will be presented with this generative theme of recursive grids and will have some time to experiment and ask questions.

Reference material and further reading suggestions will be provided.

On this short 2-day workshop we will:

- Explore basic Python syntax with the visual vocabulary of Processing
- Tackle the recursion concept (defining recursive functions)
- Study basic grid construction with nested loops
- Review a very simple recursive grid model
- Produce graphic work based on recursive grids
