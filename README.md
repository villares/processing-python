### Teaching materials for Processing and Python (with py5) ([repository](https://github.com/villares/processing-python))

#### What is it, and how to install `py5`

I recomend using [**py5** with the *thonny-py5mode* plug-in for the *Thonny IDE*](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/como-instalar-py5/index-EN.html). Also, check out [pyp5js-py5mode](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/pyp5js/py5mode) for Pyodide + p5js in the browser and [a table comparing other Processing + Python tools](https://github.com/villares/Resources-for-teaching-programming)
