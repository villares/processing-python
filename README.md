### Teaching materials for Processing and Python (with py5) ([repository](https://github.com/villares/processing-python))

> Older Processing Python mode stuff kept for posterity at https://github.com/villares/processing-python/tree/Processing-Python-mode
> For Portuguese-language materials visit [material-aulas](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/material-aulas)

#### What is it, and [**how to install py5**](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/como-instalar-py5/index-EN.html)

I recomend using **py5** with [thonny-py5mode plug-in for the Thonny IDE](). Also, check out [pyp5js](github.com/berinhard/pyp5js) for Pyodide + p5js in the browser and [a table comparing other Processing + Python tools](https://github.com/villares/Resources-for-teaching-programming)
